# hotel_booking_site
This is a project made to test and exercise my knowledge. I created a hotel booking website (both the front and the backend part) using html, css, javascript/jquery, php, sql.
The project has 5 pages in total:

1. The Login/Register page for the user.

2. Index page - the page where the user can search about the hotel they want to find.

3. The search results page based on what the user searched for (only available hotels will appear in the search results, if a hotel room is booked it will not appear here).

4. The hotel page that is different for each different hotel we have in the database (the user can also book the hotel if they wish, add reviews or add the hotel to their favorites).

5. The user profile page, where the user can see their bookings, their reviews and their favourite hotels.


Additional information: 

Public folder contains all the pages available for the user to see, together with their css.

App folder contains all the classes needed to add functionality to the project/pages.

There is an available database as well, incase you want to experiment/test the functionalities.


(You will have to download jquery files to your system for the pages that use jquery.)
